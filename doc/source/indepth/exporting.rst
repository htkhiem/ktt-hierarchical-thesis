Exporting your models
===================================================

Our system supports exporting trained models in two ways:

- Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX) format - an open, vendor-neutral format that can be deployed to almost everywhere.
- BentoML - which internally also partly uses ONNX to store models. This is to be used with our bundled REST API-powered inference system.
